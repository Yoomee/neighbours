Hi <%=@user.first_name%>,

Congratulations! We have now validated your address. Your region is live and you can now use all the current features on the Neighbours Can Help website. 

We would like to thank you for joining us in these very early days, and would ask you to please bear with us as we bring more features online and roll out to the wider Sheffield region. Neighbours Can Help is going live at different times in different streets, depending on when there are enough of neighbours online to help each other. Any help you can give by telling your friends and neighbours about Neighbours Can Help will be much appreciated!
